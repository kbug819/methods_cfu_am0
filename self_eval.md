# Self-Evaluation

### Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud of the last method built on the final_practice. I had some good productive struggle and was really excited when I figured out how to get the needed responses. I also enjoyed using conditionals within the method define - it feels good to combine the knowledge we've learned so far.
### What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- We can run the same code on dozens or more data sets. It reduces the amount of repetitive coding we need to do to get solutions to questions and needs in regards to pulling data.
